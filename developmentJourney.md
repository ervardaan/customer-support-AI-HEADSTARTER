# initialize application
- `npx create-next-app@latest`
- then give appname when prompted
- normally we get a folder with `appname` and go inside this folder to do everything but when we upload everything to github, we have to move all contents from this `appname` folder outside as our vercel deployment can't get inside this `appname` folder- thus move everything out of this `appname` folder and delete this empty folder
